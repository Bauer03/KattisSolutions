 ### Teams
 - Two teams set up for now:
    - Team 1: Caleb Early, Jory James, Paul Bauer
    - Team 2: Cornelius Bartels, Butler Frank, Amir Suboh
 - No restrictions on who types. If you're better at typing, type. If you're better at thinking, think. If you're Caleb, do both.
    - Note that typing speed matters, but is not a limiting factor. Don't stress about typing at light speed, the important thing is to solve the problems.

 ### Notes
 - You'll be allowed to bring in paper, so if you're thinking through a problem while someone else is typing and you think you know how to solve it, you can write down code on paper and then either you or one of your teammates can type it later on. 
 - You can bring any books/textbooks/notes you want. As long as it's not electronic, you can bring in a list of every possible algorithm you can think of, along with implementations.

 ### Submissions
 - There's no limit to the number of times you can submit a solution.
 - You are penalized ~30 minutes for each wrong submission - but only after you eventually get the problem right.
    - If you submit 35 wrong answers and don't solve the problem, you have 0 penalties from that.
    - If you submit 35 wrong answers and then solve the problem, you have 35 penalties of ~30 minutes.
 - Note: Getting problems wrong isn't a big deal, but avoid unnecessary submissions, since if you and another team both solve 3 problems, the team with the least total time wins (This is how we beat JMU in 2023).

 ### Strategies
 - Figure out as the semester progresses and we learn more about what we're most comfortable with.
 - Aside from actual, targeted strategies: Talk to your team, figure out how you split up work.
    - Do you think your group works best by all working on one problem simultaneously?
    - Would you be best off breaking up to look at different problems, then come together once someone thinks they have a solution?
    - Check your teammates' thought process before submitting anything, just to make sure they're not mis-interpreting the problem. Even if it's a simple problem.

### Meetings
 - We meet M/W/F at 3:00pm in the lab, MCK 226
 - We'll go over problems & strategies. If you have a problem you're stuck on, bring it up in the meeting and we'll work through it together.
 - Most important is recognizing and categorizing the algorithm and data structure(s) relevant to the problem. Actual code is important, but second.

### Outside of meetings
 - Discord channel for the team at https://discord.gg/sU2crE9K to discuss problems, strategies, etc.
 - Several resources in Discord such as Competitive Programming book, Github repos breaking down problems/strategies, and more.
 - Go to https://open.kattis.com/problems and solve at least one or two problems per week, to make sure the stuff we go over in meetings is brought up in your brain. This is important !
