### ICPC, rough schedule
 - All-day event. 
 - Usually some kind of introduction, explanation of rules, etc, then quick practice/mock session so all PCs work and all teams know how to submit a solution.
 - Lunch, then actual challenge goes for five hours. 
 - Dinner & winners announced

 ### Teams
 - Two teams set up, for now. Groups of 3 - I need to confirm who's going.
 - No restrictions on who types. If you're better at typing, type. If you're better at thinking, think. If you're Caleb, do both.
    - Note that typing speed matters, but is not a limiting factor. Don't stress about typing at light speed, the important thing is to solve the problems.

 ### Notes
 - You'll be allowed to bring in paper, so if you're thinking through a problem while someone else is typing and you think you know how to solve it, you can write down code on paper and then either you or one of your teammates can type it later on. 
 - You can bring any books/textbooks/notes you want. As long as it's not electronic, you can bring in a list of every possible algorithm you can think of, along with implementations.

 ### Submissions
 - There's no limit to the number of times you can submit a solution.
 - You are penalized ~30 minutes for each wrong submission - but only after you eventually get the problem right.
    - If you submit 35 wrong answers and don't solve the problem, you have 0 penalties from that.
    - If you submit 35 wrong answers and then solve the problem, you have 35 penalties of ~30 minutes.
 - Note: Getting problems wrong is not an issue. You'll win based on number of solved problems, wrong answers (and thus time spent on answers) are a tiebreaker. Important, yes, but it's much more important to actually solve the problems.

 ### Strategies
 - Figure out as the semester progresses and we learn more about what we're most comfortable with.
 - Aside from actual, targeted strategies: Talk to your team, figure out how you split up work.
    - Do you think your group works best by all working on one problem simultaneously?
    - Would you be best off breaking up to look at different problems, then come together once someone thinks they have a solution?
    - Check your teammates' thought process before submitting anything, just to make sure they're not mis-interpreting the problem. Even if it's a simple problem.

### Meetings
 - We meet Wed 4-5pm, MCK 226
 - Figuring out how to set up meetings today. 
 - I suggest getting into two teams (groups of 3 or not doens't matter, since I assume there will be roughly 7 of us we can do 3 & 4)
 - Solve 1-2 problems in the hour we have. Set 25-minute time limit, and at the end of that, if we haven't solved problems, 

### Outside of meetings
 - Discord channel for the team at https://discord.gg/sU2crE9K to discuss problems, strategies, etc.
 - Several resources in Discord such as Competitive Programming book, Github repos breaking down problems/strategies, and more.
 - Go to https://open.kattis.com/problems and solve at least one or two problems per week, to make sure the stuff we go over in meetings is brought up in your brain. This is important !
